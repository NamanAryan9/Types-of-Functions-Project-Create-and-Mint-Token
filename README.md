Solidity ERC20 Token Contract

# **Overview**

This Solidity program serves as a Module 3 Project demonstrating basic syntax and functionality in Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. The contract creates a custom ERC20 token and facilitates its deployment using REMIX.

# **Description**

This program implements a simple ERC20 token contract in Solidity, designed for Ethereum blockchain development. The contract includes a modifier, constructor, and functions to manage token operations.

# **Modifier:** 

Ensures that only the contract owner can access the minting function during contract deployment.

# **Constructor:** 

Initializes the contract and mints tokens to the owner's address upon deployment.

Functions: Allow users to transfer and burn tokens:

Transfer tokens: Enables any user to transfer tokens to another address.
Burn tokens: Allows any user to destroy tokens from their own account.
This project provides a foundational understanding of Solidity programming, specifically focusing on ERC20 token standards and access control mechanisms. It serves as an introductory example for beginners aiming to explore smart contract development on Ethereum.
